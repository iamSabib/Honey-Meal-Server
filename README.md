Hereâ€™s a sample README for the Honey Meal server-side project:

# Honey Meal - Server Side

Honey Meal is a Hostel Management system for university students developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This server-side part of the project handles the backend logic, including user authentication, meal data management, and payment processing. It works in conjunction with the client-side to provide a complete solution for managing hostel meals, reviews, and premium membership subscriptions.


## Live API URL
[**Honey Meal API**](https://honey-meal-server.vercel.app/)

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Handles login, registration, and JWT token management for secure access.
- **Meal Management**: API endpoints for adding, updating, deleting, and viewing meals.
- **Meal Reviews**: Users can post, edit, and delete reviews for meals.
- **Premium Membership**: Integrates Stripe for handling payments for premium memberships.
- **Stripe Payment Integration**: Secures payments for membership packages with Stripe.
- **Upcoming Meals**: Allows admins to manage and publish upcoming meals.
- **JWT Authentication**: Ensures secure communication between the client and server using JSON Web Tokens.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB for managing user data, meals, reviews, and payment records.
